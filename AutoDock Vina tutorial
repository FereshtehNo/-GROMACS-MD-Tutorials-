Step 1: 📂 Open Files
Open the protein.pdb file and the ligand.pdb file to start your docking simulation.

Step 2: 🔍 Identify Binding Site Residues
Locate the residues of the binding site that you previously determined based on your study. Use UCSF Chimera by navigating through: Tools > Sequence > Sequence. 
This will allow you to view and select the relevant residues in your protein structure.
