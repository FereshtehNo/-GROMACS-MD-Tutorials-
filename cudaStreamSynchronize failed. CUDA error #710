ðŸš€ Running Simulations
To run a GROMACS simulation, use the following command structure:

gmx mdrun -v -deffnm <simulation_name> -nt <number_of_threads>

Example:

gmx mdrun -v -deffnm npt -nt 8

Troubleshooting

CUDA Error #710
If you encounter the following error when running your GROMACS simulation:

cudaStreamSynchronize failed. CUDA error #710 (cudaErrorAssert): device-side assert triggered.

you need to adjust the settings in your npt.mdp file. Follow these steps:

Open your npt.mdp file.
Add or modify the following parameters to ensure correct temperature and pressure coupling:
; Temperature coupling is on

tcoupl = V-rescale ; modified Berendsen thermostat
tc-grps = Protein Non-Protein ; two coupling groups - more accurate
tau_t = 1 1 ; time constant, in ps
ref_t = 298.15 298.15 ; reference temperature, in K

; Pressure coupling is on
pcoupl = c-rescale ; Pressure coupling on in NPT
pcoupltype = isotropic ; uniform scaling of box vectors
tau_p = 5.0 ; time constant, in ps
ref_p = 1.0 ; reference pressure, in bar
compressibility = 4.5e-5 ; isothermal compressibility of water, bar^-1

Save the file and rerun your simulation using the gmx mdrun command.
These settings ensure proper coupling of temperature and pressure in your simulation, which may resolve the CUDA error related to device-side asserts.
